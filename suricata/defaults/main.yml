# HOME_NETWORK value(s) for suricata.
# The home network defines the ranges where services to be protected are.
# In general, attack traffic goes to HOME_NETWORK, and C2/exfiltration goes from it.
# By default, assume the address with a default route is the one to monitor.

# Interfaces for suricata to listen on.
# Using the default suricata.yml template for this role, this will:
# * add any interfaces listed to af-packet processor
# * add any interfaces listed to pf-ring processor
# * add any interfaces listed to pcap processor
# * add any interfaces listed to netmap processor
# Cluster IDs are assigned where needed by substracting the 1-indexed position
# of each entry from 100 (i.e. the first interface listed will have a cluster ID of 99).
