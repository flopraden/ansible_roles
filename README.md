ansible_roles
===============

A collection of ansible roles aiming to facilitate running secure machines and services.

It is mainly tested on CentOS (and in docker - see the Makefile).
It also largely assumes a fairly recent system - e.g. systemd as init manager, the ability to install docker, etc.

Individual roles have their own READMEs (soon to be populated with more than boilerplate).

It is also generally worthwhile looking into each role's defaults/main.yml.
These tend to provide (some) documentation for the main settings one might want to change.
